% Main text.
\citet{2015ApJ...807....2C} demonstrated that the high-velocity channels of CO
emission observed with \citep{Cleeves_ea_2015a} was inconsistent with a model
with a typical thermal structure. The authors advocated for a warp in the disk,
such that the inclination changes from $i \approx 8\degr$ at 5~au, increasing
to $i \approx 5\degr$ at 100~au, a finding consistent with the azimuthal
dependence observed in scattered light by NICMOS on the \gls{HST}
\citep{2015ApJ...799..204C}. A similar skewed rotation profile observed in the
transition disk HD~142527 from CO emission was interpreted as radial inflow of
gas onto the central star \citep{1994A&A...291..943O, Cleeves_ea_2015a,
2015ApJ...799..204C}. Someone demonstrated that it is impossible to distinguish
between a warped inner disk and radial in-fall onto the star, requiring other
diagnostics to help distinguish between scenarios.
