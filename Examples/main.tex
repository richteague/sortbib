\citet{2015ApJ...807....2C} demonstrated that the high-velocity channels of CO 
emission observed with \citep{Cleeves_ea_2015a} was inconsistent with a model 
with a typical thermal structure. The authors advocated for a warp in the disk, 
such that the inclination changes from $i \approx 8\degr$ at 5~au, increasing 
to $i \approx 5\degr$ at 100~au, a finding consistent with the azimuthal 
dependence observed in scattered light by NICMOS on the \gls{HST} 
\citep{2015ApJ...799..204C}. A similar skewed rotation profile observed in the
 transition disk HD~142527 from CO emission was interpreted as radial inflow 
 of gas onto the central star \citep{1994A&A...291..943O}. 
 \citet{2015ApJ...799..204C} demonstrated that it is impossible to distinguish 
 between a warped inner disk and radial in-fall onto the star, requiring other 
 diagnostics to help distinguish between scenarios.
