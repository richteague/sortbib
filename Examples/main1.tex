% Main text.
[1] demonstrated that the high-velocity channels of CO
emission observed with [2] was inconsistent with a model
with a typical thermal structure. The authors advocated for a warp in the disk,
such that the inclination changes from $i \approx 8\degr$ at 5~au, increasing
to $i \approx 5\degr$ at 100~au, a finding consistent with the azimuthal
dependence observed in scattered light by NICMOS on the \gls{HST}
[3]. A similar skewed rotation profile observed in the
transition disk HD~142527 from CO emission was interpreted as radial inflow of
gas onto the central star [4, 2, 3]. Someone demonstrated that it is impossible to distinguish
between a warped inner disk and radial in-fall onto the star, requiring other
diagnostics to help distinguish between scenarios.
